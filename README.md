# CF-Mentor
A Windows application that is developed to establish a connection with Codeforces API, which aids in the discovery of new problems to solve and enables the monitoring of progress.

I have always Wanted to develop an application or software program that could function as a guide or mentor in the realm of competitive programming, simplifying the process of tracking progress and motivating users to improve. This software would ideally possess a user-friendly interface to enhance ease of use.
